This project wants to improve the workflow within my team, being able to easily keep track of all the material taken from the warehouse.

In the future, this application will create statistics on the use of all the material,
suggesting monthly orders based on stock in the warehouse,
and will allow the creation of Excel files to send to logistics to order new material.

This application will be released for Android and iOS for internal use only.
